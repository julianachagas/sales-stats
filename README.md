# Sales Stats

This project consists of handling sales data and stats from an API of a fictional e-commerce. The goal was to practice data manipulation in TypeScript.

The project is part of the TypeScript Course from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/curso/typescript-para-iniciantes/), a Brazilian learning platform. The API used in the project was created specifically for this course and contains data about clients and sales.

The page contains a table that displays the sales, with the name of the client, email, total paid, payment method, and payment status.

Various stats are calculated from the fetched data such as:

- Total sum of sales in Brazilian Reais (R$)
- Number of sales by payment method (Credit Card/Invoice)
- Number of sales by payment status (Paid/Awaiting Payment/Refunded/Denied by the credit card issuer)
- Best day of the week for sales

The data and the stats are displayed in Portuguese as it's the original language of the API data and the course.
